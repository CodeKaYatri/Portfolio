Build a modern, visually calm, color-themed, premium portfolio website using React (functional components) + Tailwind CSS.  
Use a soothing theme based on soft neutral tones (off-white #FAF9F6, very light beige), pastel teal, pastel blue, and subtle gradients.  
Layout must be clean, airy, spacious, minimal, and eye-friendly with soft shadows, smooth animations, and gentle hover states.  
Design should feel peaceful, modern, and professional.
